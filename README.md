Given Problem:
Consider two six-sided faces namely Die A and Die B with faces numbered from 1 to 6. Both the dice are rolled together.
1.	How many total combinations are possible? Show the math along with the code?
2.	2.Calculate and display the distribution of all possible combinations that can be obtained when rolling both Die A and Die B together.
3.	Calculate the Probability of all Possible Sums occurring among the number of combinations from (2).Example: P(Sum = 2) = 1/X as there is only one combination possible to obtain Sum = 2. Die A = Die B = 1.
Solution :
This is a Doomed Dice roller Problem 
I have solved this using Python Flask web Frame work and diplay the results with Html and Css elements
